MK Log
======

DevLog
------

### Usage

Simply call the `GeneralUtility::devLog` or the old `t3lib_div::devLog` method 
to log data to the DevLog-Module.  
We recommend to use `Tx_Rnbase_Utility_Logger` as warpper.

In the Module *MK Log* at the Web-View you can view and filter these logs and its content.
