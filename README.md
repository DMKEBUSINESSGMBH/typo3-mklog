mklog
=======

This extensions offers a scheduler task, the watch dog, which aggregates devlog entries and sends them via mail. So it is possible to send a mail with fatal errors the minute they occur but warnings only every 6 hours. Or send a mail with infos from an import every night.

Of course the devlog has to be used by the core and extensions. To have exceptions and errors logged to the devlog the error handling of mktools can be used.
